# Lab Notebook of Kathryn Schuler

This repository contains summaries of all of the experiments I have run.  I keep a single summary file in the form of an iPython or R notebook for each experiment.  Visit my [experiment wiki](https://guide.kathrynschuler.com) for details on how I run experiments.
